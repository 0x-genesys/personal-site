#### Some history

- My dad sold his Golf kit back in 1998 to buy a computer for me (Win 98 OS), I enjoyed playing on it. Alladin and Robocop were my favorites. Till date I am not sure if Alladin had a final chapter.

- I remember being fascinated with floppy disks and CD Roms. I engineered and reverse-engineered toys from child hood.

- In school I took great interest in computers, from class 9th. I had mastered C++ and Java basics in 9th Grade. I got addicted to solving computer problems. 

- At college I took keen interest in computer gaming and also attended many computer workshops. I started building and selling Android apps in my final year, completely supporting myself from them. I had many customers , and interacted with some over emails. I still remember getting my first Amazon cheque from Amazon's App Store. 

- Soon after college, along with my freelance work, I pursued CCNA and networking for some time. Then I shifted to Google as a vendor where I on boarded large hotel chains (like Hilton) on Google Hotel Platform. My role was that of technical and business one.

- From there I shifted to a fintech startup backed by Naspers (PayUMoney). At PayUMoney I built their Merchant App from scratch. I was an early hire there and worked on Payments SDK as well. 

- In 2015 I joined [Urbanclap](https://www.urbanclap.com/) as an early hire. I worked on Android apps (Customer and Merchant). I also worked on building chat in their apps (backend and frontend), using XMPP and ejabberd. 

- In 2017, I shifted to backend role in Urbanclap. I led their SEO efforts and also worked on the match making algorithm. Organic traffic charts shooted the sky and the entire team was praised by founders.

- In 2018, I started my blockchain startup. I had found interest in Blockchain and built software and hardware wallets. Also worked on ERC20 projects for clients and raised money through services. We were team of 8 strong (including IIT interns). Unfortunately, due to Indian regulations came later in the year against blockchain, and we had to close the startup.

- I joined Springrole, Bangalore after shutting my startup, as technical lead. Currently I lead Springrole verticals , delivering tech-product fit results.

- I also have interests in cosomolgy , theoretical physics and maths. 

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
